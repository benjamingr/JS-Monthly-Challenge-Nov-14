###What's this about

The idea is to learn a new technology, code something fun and share knowledge, opinions and experience. The scope is meant to be rather small. It's something one should be able to hack together in an evening of work.

You may put as little or as much work into this as you'd like, it is encouraged to extend what you're making beyond the official challenge and to add capabilities.

###Monthly Challenge of the JS room, November 2014. 

The elected idea is [the following](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/276690/1348195):

**KnockoutJS**

**Task:** Use Knockout 3 and the [SE API](http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/excerpt-search#order=desc&sort=activity&body=jquery&filter=default&site=stackoverflow&run=true) to create a form for searching SO question bodies and dynamically returning those that match a criteria. The questions returned should refresh once every minute. Question should be formatted nicely. 

Extra points for slick UI and additional data processing and goodies. You may use a compile-to-js language if you'd like. The only requirement is to use KnockoutJS in your UI code. 

###Getting Started

You are to use [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) and [the Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/). The Stack Exchange API. A good resource for learning Knockout is their [awesome tutorial](http://learn.knockoutjs.com/). There are no enforced coding standards. You may use any additional libraries you'd like.

###Submission

Submission of entries is done through pull requests to this repository. Make a pull request with a `yourusername` folder containing:

    yourUserName
      - index.html  # opening this should run your submission
      - ... # any additional files required to run your submission

If your submission requires running server side code or other code prior to running it, nest the `index.html` file one level in a `www` folder.

###How a winner will be chosen

The winner is always Zirak. Sorry, that's just the way things our. ---The Winner--- Zirak [will be announced](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/8231986#8231986) after fair and democratic balot voting will be held after Dec 1st.
